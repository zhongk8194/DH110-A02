### Introduction
<a href="https://cnn.com"> CNN.com</a> is the website of the news television channel, CNN (Cable News Network). The site communicates top news to its viewers, with content spanning a variety of topics. Such topics include US/ world news, politics, business, health, entertainment, tech, travel, sports, weather, and more. The website also promotes their live television channel through the website by alllowing website viewers to watch the channel live right on their devices.

When conducting the heuristic evaluation of CNN.com, I noticed issues that could hinder the site's usability. By performing a usability test for CNN.com, the site's interface and ease-of-use can be assessed. This assessment could then lead to an awareness of what issues need to be fixed and how they could be solved. Furthermore, by documenting a potential user's experience with the site, we can get a better understanding of how a typical user might use the site and deduce ways to improve their experience. 

Three usability issues that I found from my heuristic evaluation are as follows: 
1. Inconsistent navigation bar on pages due to multiple website sections
2. Cluttered, unorganized, and not minimal home page
3. Certain categories/ features are hard to find

By performing a usability test in regards to the issues mentioned above, a better understanding on what kinds of tasks are difficult and what are easy can be developed. Specifically, the first task will test whether a user would be able to navigate between different sections of the website while utilizing the navigation bar. This will The second task will determine whether a user could locate the "Trending" section of the homepage through all of the clutter. Lastly, the third task will test whether a user could find specific information that falls under a category. These tasks will serve to analyze the effectiveness of the website's content organization, features, and aesthetics. 

### Methodology 
For my usability test, I performed it at UCLA using my laptop. I used Zoom to record my usability test, which captured my participant and me, the test material, and the CNN website. This was a pilot trial that was meant to test the materials and structure of the usability test. 

The usability test was divided into the following steps: 
1. Orientation (introduction)
2. Consent form 
3. Background questions 
4. Pre-test questionnaire 
5. Task 1
6. Task 2
7. Task 3
8. Post-test questionnaire 
9. SUS questionnaire 
10. Product satisfaction cards 
11. Demographics

### Reflection 
**What I learned**
<br>
From the usability test, I learned what CNN.com did well and did not do well. For example, I learned that while some features of the website, such as the recommended articles at the bottom of each article, were enjoyed, the website overall was viewed as very content and text heavy and could therefore be confusing. I also learned that some of the features that CNN.com had implemented were difficult to find, such as the individual sections on the "Biden Presidency" subpage. 
<br>
**What went well and what went not well**
<br>
Overall, the usability test went smoothly. I was able to gain insight into the thoughts of a user with an unbiased perspective, especially because she had not used the website before. There was definitely trust between participant and moderator; she felt comfortable with voicing her thoughts and talking me through her process. However, because of our environment, there were some potential issues with sound â€” a helicopter flew above us for a couple of seconds. Furthermore, I did not anticipate the "Trending" section of the home page being changed in the couple of hours between the creation of my form and the time of the usability test; I had to change the task a little bit while my participant was performing rasks. 
<br>
**Improving UT for the future**
<br>
For future usability tests, I will check my test materials right before the test to ensure that there are no mistakes. Additionally, I would like to perform the test in a better environment where no noises could lead to distractions. This pilot test helped me to become aware of potential testing problems that I can keep in mind for the future.
